# Devto replica - Frontend

Devto replicata is my final challenge as part of the React module in Kodemia bootcamp. This project aims to replicate the DevTo website, primarily using React components. Unlike traditional routing solutions, Next.js was utilized for its dynamic routing capabilities. Additionally, it integrates with the backend API developed during the backend challenge.

## Features

- **React Components:** Built primarily using React components.
- **Next.js Routing:** Leverages Next.js for dynamic routing.
- **API Integration:** Utilizes the backend API created during the challenge.
- **Form Handling:** Implements react-hook-form for form management.
- **Conditional Styling:** Utilizes clsx for easy conditional styling.
